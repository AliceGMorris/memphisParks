 Park Explorer for the City of Memphis
To use the application, users should filter their desired park amenities. This will update both the table of applicable features and the map. The map will also display reported maintainance issues.
Users have the option to leave or view reviews. Viewing reviews had to become a seperate webpage due to contraints of the feature layer lacking geometry and the exisiting feature table.
The third button allows the user to report issues they come across at a park.
